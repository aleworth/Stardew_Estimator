# Stardew_Estimator
This is the beginning of an application meant to help budding farmers decide which crops would be most valuable for them at harvest in the game Stardew Valley. It will eventually be able to calculate the overall return of a crop("value") based on the current day the player is on and the amount of money the character has to spend.
